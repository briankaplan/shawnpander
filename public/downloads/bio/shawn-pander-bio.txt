Singer-Songwriter | Musician

Biography

Texan born singer-songwriter Shawn Pander has an appeal to his roots-pop acoustic narratives that was come by honestly. A deep appreciation for his own soulful upbringing has given him the empathy to connect with listeners in a sincere and direct way. Pander's blues-jazz-influenced songs strike deeply and precisely, provoking the same type of authentic emotional experience achieved lyrically by some of music's greatest storytellers.

In fact, he was destined to tell a good story. Pander's musical journey began as a five-year-old boy. While keeping his father company at work— a used car lot on the outskirts of Houston— Shawn befriended an elderly blues man they called Homeless James, who played guitar along the sidewalk. An odd couple they were, as James dealt young Shawn a strong and very real dose of true Americana roots music. Eventually the business "went under" so Shawn went to say goodbye to his unlikely mentor and that fateful last encounter set him on a lifelong journey as a musician. "If I'm not going to see you again, you'll need this," James said, selflessly handing over his beloved Yamaha SG75 guitar. Now, decades later, Shawn's strives to honor the story that started with James. He still writes most all of his material on that old guitar.
